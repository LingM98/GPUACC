GPUACC is a project focused on exploring and benchmarking the performance of low-rank tensor decomposition methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on GPUs. The project aims to leverage the parallelism of GPU computing to accelerate tensor decompositions, improving the efficiency of high-dimensional PDE solutions in various scientific and engineering applications.
